# 🌱 Waste Classification System
A deep learning-based **Streamlit web app** that classifies waste as either **Organic** or **Recyclable** using image input. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and styled with a clean, nature-friendly UI. This tool promotes sustainability and environmental awareness by making waste sorting smarter and easier.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This system is designed to help identify and categorize waste images into two categories:
- Organic Waste 🌿
- Recyclable Waste ♻️
The user simply uploads an image, and the model predicts if the waste is organic or recyclable.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Classification** : Classifies uploaded waste images into two categories: Organic and Recyclable.
- **Real-time Prediction** : The app provides instant feedback on uploaded waste images.
- **Custom Styling** : The web app is visually appealing with a custom background and centered buttons for better user experience.
- **Background Image** : A beautiful eco-friendly background image is used to enhance the overall aesthetics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** : For building the web app interface.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** : For model building and predictions.
- **OpenCV** : For image processing.
- **Base64** : For encoding and setting the background image.
